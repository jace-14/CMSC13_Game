How to Compile using CMD:

1. Open cmd

2. Change your directory to where the game folder is located.
	E.g. if the folder is located at the Desktop, enter "cd Desktop" to change directory into the
		desktop. Once in the desktop directory, enter "cd *Game Folder Name*" and in this instance
		that would be "cd CMSC13_Game"

3. Once inside the directory of the game folder, change directory once more and proceed to the src folder
	by entering "cd src"

4. Now inside the src folder, it is time to compile and run the program.
	To do this, first enter "javac -cp "libs\*;." -encoding UTF-8 MainForm.java"

5. And finally to run the program, simply enter "java -cp "libs\*;." MainForm"
